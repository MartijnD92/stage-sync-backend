# The Stage Sync App
***The development of this app was part of my graduation project for the Full-Stack Development bootcamp at Novi.***

Stage Sync allows a user to synchronize a roster of artists (musical or otherwise) over multiple devices and monitor everything related to their upcoming and past shows, expenses and general schedules.
