# The StageSync App â€“ Back-end

**_The development of this app was part of my graduation project for the Full-Stack Development bootcamp at Novi. This is only the front-end part of the fullstack project. You'll find the front-end repository [here](https://github.com/MartijnD92/stage-sync-frontend)._**

StageSync allows a user to synchronize a roster of artists (musical or otherwise) over multiple devices and monitor everything related to their upcoming and past shows, expenses and general schedules.
